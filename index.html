        <h2>About the series</h2>

        <p>Black History Month is a time we celebrate Black excellence, especially in the faith and justice arena. Historically, the Black church has been a place of refuge and engagement for justice that includes advocating against hunger and poverty. Be inspired by the messages of God’s love delivered by young adult Black faith leaders and engage in the noble legacy of what has become known as the Black Church. </p>

        <p>Rev. David Street and young adult Black faith leaders from the Bread for the World network host a series of online worship services for Black History Month. Faith leaders lift up themes of love, peace, and justice throughout their message and speak to God's call to put our faith in action, with music by Pastor Phillip Carter. </p>
